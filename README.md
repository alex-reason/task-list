This is a simple application to show using context in a task list app. The main goal is to show creation of components and interaction with each other through createContext and useContext instead of passing down props.

The project is based on a section of the online course from Udemy called: Modern React with Redux [2023 Update] by Stephen Grider. This is for practicing what I learned from that course, specifically React useContext.

It would be good to store the list of tasks in a database.
