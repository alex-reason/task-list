# task-list
task list creator app used with react; app is for react context practice only. 
This is based on a project on an online course from Udemy called: Modern React with Redux [2023 Update] by Stephen Grider.
This is for practicing what I learned from that course, specifically react useContext; it would be great to use a database, but I will skip that here!
